Please, bear in mind that there are some **mandatory data** you should include at this step:

-  <u>__Cancellation policies__</u>: _Within the cancelPolicy structure response there is a **refundable** field. If this field is filled in with false, it means that the room has 100% cancellation cost, so the room is non-refundable._
-  <u>__Remarks__</u>
-  <u>__Taxes__</u>
