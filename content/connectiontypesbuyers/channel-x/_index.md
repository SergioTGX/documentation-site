Channel-X is an aggregating tool that allows a third partner to receive the product of the different Channel Managers in an unique standardized API. The objective of this solution is to **speed up** the extraction and the combination of the product for the Buyer. In order for this to work, Buyers should develop the *Channel-X* integration to receive the inventory in their system and be able to dispatch all the information to their clients.

To know more details on how Channel-X works, visit the [Overview](./overview) section and the API reference, and check how easy is to receive all the inventory in order to reduce search traffic to an external system and create price calendars to your clients.
