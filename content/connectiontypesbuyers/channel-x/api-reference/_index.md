The API described in this document is used to transmit rate, availability and inventory, data between Channel-X and a partner system. A full implementation of this API requires that the partner system provides a service endpoint that accepts requests from Channel-X of the following types: *HotelRatePlanInventoryNotif*, *HotelRatePlanNotif*, *HotelAvailNotif*.

You will find detailed information and examples of each method in the *Messages* section. In *Code List* you will find all codes used by the system.
