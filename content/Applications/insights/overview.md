In order to analyze and **produce useful insights**, Insights extracts, loads and consolidates data from our Marketplace.  

Once the data is consolidated in our data warehouse, we can share data with Partners already connected to our platform. You will have access to accurate data regarding your performance, ratios, prices, product usage... With these insights an accurate benchmarking against competitors is provided so that our partners can gain a competitive advantage. 

{{% alert theme="info" %}}We don't expose our partnersâ€™ data because we use anonymous competitive sets.{{% /alert %}}

## Datasets
Insights will allow access to different [datasets](../datasets/dataset-content) with structured data to perform any kind of analysis, supported in different [dataset publication formats](../datasets/datasets-formats/).

## Tooling
If you don't have your own reporting tool, the easiest way to interact with Insights datasets is via our free [Google Data Studio Templates](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/navigation/reporting).
