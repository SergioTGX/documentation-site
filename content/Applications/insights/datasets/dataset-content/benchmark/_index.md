Benchmark datasets offer you the **competitive advantage** of knowing **how you are doing with respect to the competition**. The benchmark is available for:

* **Performance**. The comparisons are based on the ratio of searches, quotes, bookings and cancellation ok requests, plus you will be able to compare your time responses with respect to other competitors.
* **Insights**. The comparisons are based on the number of available hotels, total bookings and net revenue, plus you will be able to see your position with respect to other competitors filtering at the level of country, city and clients/suppliers.
