On this page you will learn how the data is stored in Benchmark Hotel Rates Dataset and how to interpret the differents table fields.

# Overview

The data used corresponds to the search and book transactions for the last 30 days that meet the following criteria:ç

* Check-in dates by week, starting current week and up to 6 months.
* Requests for 1 room and 2 adults.
* Hotels have been mapped against at least another Seller in TravelgateX.

Price is per night in euros (€) and only from net transactions. Total search and book requests with net prices are also included in the report, both your organization's requests and those to your competitors.

{{% alert theme="info" %}}All prices shown correspond to the minimum price that has been returned for the same hotel and specific market + week of check-in, so in the vast majority of cases you are comparing your most basic rate to the most basic rate of your competitors.{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert theme="warning" %}}Please note that the data provided in this report depends on the results obtained from hotel mapping, where it is possible that an incorrect mapping statement was made or that not all possible hotel mappings were considered.{{% /alert %}}

This dataset is updated weekly.
