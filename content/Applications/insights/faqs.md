Insights data is aggregated on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. 


* **Can I compare two time ranges in one report?**

Yes. Insights has up to three years historical data. So it is possible to compare data to previous periods.


## **Performance Data Sets:**


* **If I do “multi search” for search request, how are these searches captured in Insights?**

In Performance datasets, search requests counts multisearch as one unique search. However, in Insights datasets, the request goes till hotel level, it would be equivalent to N hotel searches for each multi-search.


* **How is “%Searches Ok” calculated?**

In Performance datasets, the percentage of searches ok is calculated over the total amount of search requests, no matter the amount of searched hotels.
However, in Insights datasets, that metric is calculated over the total of one specific hotel.


* **Are searches made for price comparison included in “Searches”?**

Yes. All searches are included, even those made to compare rates or create rate calendars.


* **How has “Response Time” been calculated on searches ,quotes, bookings and cancellations?**

Response Time (RP) is the total time aggregated. Example: client RP + TGX RP-supplier RP + TGX RP+ client RP


* **What do errors on searches, quotes and bookings mean and how could I solve each type?**

    * **“No results”**:  it is a common error and refers to “non availability” for one search (hotel, distribution, check in, nights, etc).

    * **“Communication”**: time out due to problems to connect with providers.

    * **“Seller”**: error returned by the supplier that could not be tagged.

    * **“Bad Request”**: means bad requests: the supplier does not accept the distribution, dates or the requests.

## **Insights Data Sets:**


* **Revenue is always in Euros currency; how is the exchange calculated?**

Everyday Insights check the exchange rate and convert all currencies to Euros.

Although some providers allow searches by destination (non standard destinations), at this moment TravelgateX only captures hotel requests. 


* **What does “source market” refer to?**

* **How is “Amount Cancelled” calculated ?**

“Amount Cancelled” is the total amount of cancelled revenue from the cancelled bookings in a period of time.


* **Some fields like “origin market” or “destination” do not return real values, just “-” or “null”. Why is this happening?**

When clients or providers do not send the value on the field, Insights captures the register as “null”. We recommend investigate the case and find out the provider / client that is not sharing the right value.

Cancel window is the average time (days) between the booking date and the date the booking was canceled. 


* **In case of cancelled bookings, would the revenue from bookings be updated?**

Yes. Revenue from bookings and cancelled revenue will be updated every day once cancelled bookings data has been checked.

Hotels displayed in Portfolio report are unique at a provider level.

Thanks to Portfolio dataset you will be able to monitor hotels portfolio for each client / provider. It is possible to analyse at a hotel level, the total requests, errors, performance ratios from search to book, number of bookings, cancelations, etc.


* **How to understand hotel “status” on portfolio page?**
    * **"Hotels not in portfolio queried"**: requested hotels not available in provider’s portfolio. Those requests might happen due to mapping errors or non updated inventory.

    * **"Hotels not queried"**: hotels in provider’s portfolio not being requested. One of the reasons might be that mapping is not updated or the client does not operate in that destination.

    * **"Hotels in portfolio queried"**: hotels in provider’s portfolio being requested.

    * **"Hotels not dadded"**: hotels requested but not added in provider’s portfolio. If you are on the client side, we recommend you to check with your providers that hotels have been updated on TravelgateX platform.
