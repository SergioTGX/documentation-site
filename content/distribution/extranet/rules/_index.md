You will find the following 4 sections in your "General Settings", both at ``Organization`` and ``Agency`` level:

* Configuration
* Selling Pricing Rules
* General Stop Sales
* Specific Stop Sales

You will also be able to identify if these rules are applied to your ``Organization`` (*General Settings*) or only to a specific ``Agency`` (*Agency name*) by checking the top menu.
