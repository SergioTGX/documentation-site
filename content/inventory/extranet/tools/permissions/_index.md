The Permissions section allows you to assign a user to different hotels or Channel Managers:

* [Provider - User to Provider](#provider-user-to-provider)
* [User to Hotels](#user-to-hotels)

</br>

## Provider - User to Provider

From this section a user with a ``Provider`` role is given access to one or many providers/Channel Managers.

In order to give permissions to a particular user, you just have to click the ``Add new UserProvider â€“ Provider`` button.

A pop up window will show in which you will be able to introduce the hotel name for the hotel to which the user will have access. The `Can Edit all Rates from Hotel` option allows you to indicate if you want this user to be able to edit all rate from the hotel or specify some of them:

You can also give access to a user for all hotels you have setup with one or more Channel Manager. For this you must select ``All hotels from provider`` and a list with all channels accessible for this user will appear.
