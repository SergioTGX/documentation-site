Our Inventory system allows each Buyer to connect several channels and every connection implies a client-channel relation. Each configuration is totally independent from other client-channel relations. For example, one client can be related with two channels so there are two relations ``Client - Channel1`` and ``Client - Channel2``. Those two channels may have the same hotel configured, however the configuration of this hotel could be totally independent from the two different relations. Therefore, this hotel may have different rates, rooms or prices in `Client - Channel1` and ``Client - Channel2``. In all extranet sections you will be asked to select a client and a channel (a relation) in order to carry out the configuration.
