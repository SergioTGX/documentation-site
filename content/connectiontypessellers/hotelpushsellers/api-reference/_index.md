## Messages used in the Inventory API

Inventory's API messages have been structured in three parts:

* **SetUp:** Messages to retrieve or notify the hotel, rate and room structure.
* **Product Load:** Messages to load and read availability conditions and prices.
* **Booking flow:** Messages to notify or retrieve bookings and cancellations.

You will find detailed information and examples of each method in the *Messages* section. In *Code List* you will find all codes used by the system.
