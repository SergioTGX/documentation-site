# ***Important information:***

* You must always load only *one* price type per message/notif. If you send different price type in the same message, our system will only use and load one with the following criteria: price by occupancy, price by guest/standard occupancy, price per room. If you send different price type for the same day in different messages, only the newest one would be loaded.
* The prices under the standard occupancy are ALWAYS loaded with **BaseByGuestAmts**.
* Children and babies are not allowed in ``BaseByGuestAmts``. Children and babies must always be defined in AdditionalGuestAmounts.
* The possible Type values in the AdditionalGuestAmount tag are **Exclusive** and **not specified**.
    * If there's **no value specified** then the price is a relative and it's added to the price of the current pax.
    * If the value is **"Exclusive"** then the price is absolute and it's the total price of the current pax.
* If NumberOfGuests is not specified in tag ``BaseByGuestAmt`` then ``Type="25"`` (price per room) or ``Type="14"`` (price per occupancy) must be specified. If ``Type="25"`` only one tag ``BaseByGuestAmt`` is allowed.
* If the price is per room then all ``AdditionalGuestAmount`` must be relative.
* If the price is per occupancy then ``Type`` should be ``14`` and ``Code`` should be specified. 
* The occupancy code is defined by AdultNumber-ChildNumber-InfantNumber, for an occupancy of 2 adults, 1 child and 0 babies should be "2-1-0". In the examples, the room uses are specified using = AdultNumber - ChildNumber - InfantNumber.



## **Notify amounts by Guests (Standard Occupancy):**
