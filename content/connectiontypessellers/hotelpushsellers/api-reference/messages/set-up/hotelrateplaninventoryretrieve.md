If your Rate Plan has information about Meal Plans included in it, this will be shown in the MealsIncluded tag.

In the previous example we received one hotel, one Rate Plan and 2 rooms. One of the rooms appears twice because each appearance shows the different occupancies. STD2 room has 2 possible occupations: 2 adults + 1 child or
2 adults.
