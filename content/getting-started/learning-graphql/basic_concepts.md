### What are Queries & Mutations

There are two basic operations in GraphQL schemas:
<ul><li> **Queries**: Requesting data from a data model. An example `Query` would be: checking availability of hotels for a particular date and location</li>
<li> **Mutations**: Making changes and carrying out transactions on data in the data model. An example `Mutation` would be: making a booking to reserve a hotel room on a particular date.</li></ul>

## Queries 
Queries ask the system to provide some data, based on specfic parameters. This operation reads values from the server using a GraphQL `Object` and returns JSON text as a response.

Queries are interactive. You can use our [API Playground](https://api.travelgatex.com/) to test your queries.

## Mutations 
Mutations are methods that change the data on the server. That is, mutations make a physical change to the data. This can include inserting a new object in a database, or deleting, or updating a data record.
